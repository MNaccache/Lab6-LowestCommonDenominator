# Lab6-LowestCommonDenominator
Lab 6 of my CS145 class, everything was written by me. 
It take in two fractions and gives you the lowest common denominator for them, plus it calculates the new numerators. 
This lab was mostly just to learn recursion, which is really cool! 
Also, I think it's worth acknowledging that I spelled denominator wrong in all of the comments in the code. It doesn't matter enough for me to fix it, but it's still a thing.
